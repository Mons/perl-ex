NAME
    XML::Parser::Style::EasyTree - (deprecated by ETree) Parse xml to simple
    tree

PLEASE USE ETREE INSTEAD
    This module intersects with XML::Parser::EasyTree (I didn't found it
    before commit because of missing '::Style' in it's name)

    But since we are using same style name, we're mutual exclusive ;(

    It is leaved as a compatibility wrapper to XML::Parser::Style::ETree (If
    you use it, all your code will keep working)

    But I recommend to use "ETree" instead

    All documentation look in XML::Parser::Style::ETree
