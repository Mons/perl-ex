DESCRIPTION
    This class provides a hash of AnyEvent namespace CPAN Authors' PAUSE ID
    and name to the Acme::CPANAuthors module.

    It is currently statically generated information, I hope to make it
    dynamic in the future.

    ID/name via email or RT so we can always keep this module up to date.

    And if you aren't a AnyEvent CPAN author listed here, please send us
